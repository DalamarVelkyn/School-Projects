		<div class="paragraph">
			Many books have been written on the subject of libertarianism, 
			free markets, and the concept of personal responsibility,
			so difficult for some people to grasp. I do not intend to write
			a book, but merely a short description of what a Libertarian is.
		</div>
		
		<div class="paragraph">
			Considering the turmoil of the 2016 United States presidential 
			election, it is no wonder that so many people are looking for an
			option outside the Democratic and Republican parties who have been
			running the show for decades, thriving not on advancing the will 
			of the American people, but being at each other's throats and serving
			interests of those willing to pay.

			Every political party in the United States has their mascot animal, 
			and so does the Libertarian party. Libertarians have chosen a porcupine
			as their mascot and not without a good reason. Just like a porcupine, 
			Libertarians want to leave you alone, and themselves be left alone. But,
			when faced with a threat, they will show their quills.

			The now-famous Democratic donkey was first associated with Democrat 
			Andrew Jackson's 1828 presidential campaign. His opponents called 
			him a jackass (a donkey), and Jackson decided to use the image of the 
			strong-willed animal on his campaign posters. Later, cartoonist Thomas 
			Nast used the Democratic donkey in newspaper cartoons and made the symbol 
			famous. Nast invented another famous symbol; the Republican elephant. In a 
			cartoon that appeared in Harper's Weekly in 1874, Nast drew a donkey clothed 
			in lion's skin, scaring away all the animals at the zoo. One of those animals, 
			the elephant, was labeled 'The Republican Vote.' That's all it took for 
			the elephant to become associated with the Republican Party.

		<div class="paragraph">
			Unlike the Republicans, or the Democrats, Libertarians want the federal government
			to be reduced in its role to the bare minimum, and while just like with any good idea,
			there is a lot of discussion about the subject. Most libertarians will agree that
			the role of a government is to only interfere when someone's life or safety is at risk 
			through actions of another. Libertarians will let you make your own mistakes and learn 
			from them.
		</div>
		
		<div class="paragraph">
			Basic principle of a Libertarian is non-interventionism. "Live and let live" so to speak. 
			After all, who is better suited to make decisions about someone's life, if not the 
			individual? The same principle applies in all facets of personal, professional, and 
			political life of a libertarian. As long as your actions aren't hurting anyone but yourself,
			who are we to tell you otherwise?
